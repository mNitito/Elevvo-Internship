# Task 2 - Customer Segmentation

This project focuses on segmenting customers from the Mall Customers dataset using unsupervised clustering techniques.

## What we did:

- Loaded and explored the dataset containing customer demographics, annual income, and spending scores.
- Performed data normalization to prepare for clustering.
- Visualized natural groupings via scatter plots.
- Applied K-Means clustering to identify 5 customer segments and analyzed cluster characteristics.
- Used the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Explored an alternative clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, tuning parameters (`eps` and `min_samples`) to detect clusters and noise.
- Visualized parameter tuning results with heatmaps for better model selection.
- Interpreted cluster profiles to guide targeted marketing strategies based on income and spending behaviors.

## Tools and Libraries:

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (KMeans, DBSCAN)

## Business Insight:

Customer segmentation allows personalized marketing approaches, loyalty programs for high spenders, engagement strategies for low spenders, and understanding customer diversity to boost overall business performance.
